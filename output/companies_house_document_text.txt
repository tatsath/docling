## Introduction

The directors are pleased to present their strategic report for the year ended 31 December 2024 for iBanFirst Limited that operates solely within the United Kingdom.

The company is part of the wider Condor iBanFirst group, whose parent entity Condor Holdco SRL is incorporated in Belgium.

Global management income for the year ended 31 December 2024 was €64.4m with an Adjusted EBITDA of

## Business review

The directors were pleased with the overall performance of the company in 2024. Revenue came in at €3.85m, a 72% improvement compared to 2023.

In 2024, the Company achieved its goal of becoming an authorised E-Money issuer, marking a significant milestone in strengthening its market position : This achievement provides iBanFirst with a competitive edge over smaller firms in an increasingly saturated market: Client feedback has been highly positive , particularly regarding the   flexibility this   status offers most   notably  through the introduction of nominated  currency accounts, which have streamlined foreign customer credit control for many of our clients.

Looking ahead to 2025, we anticipate a substantial increase in E-Money deposit within our safeguarded accounts, driving higher interest income: While the additional income from higher interest inflows is valuable, the directors view the true opportunity of the new permission is in leveraging our growing client base to crosssell our core foreign exchange products, further strengthening our primary revenue stream.

## Financial performance indicators key

Trading revenue and net income are the primary indicators relevant to the Company, the results of which have been highlighted in the review below:

Revenue for the year amounted to E3,856,198 (2023: E2,235,883) , and net loss for the year stood at E629,913 (2023: -1,465,408). These results show a significant increase in profitability, with a 72% increase in revenue and a 57% improvement in the bottom line: The primary drivers of this significant increase are improved tech offerings to clients through full integration of a new client platform, the success of the sales team, and the general easing of macroeconomic conditions.

## Principal risks and uncertainties

The directors have determined that the principal risks and uncertainties to the Company are outlined below:

## Macroeconomic environment:

The recent past has underscored how rapidly the macroeconomic landscape can evolve: Easing monetary conditions throughout 2024 created a more favourable environment for business activity, with increased liquidity supporting operational investment across many sectors. However, early indicators in 2025 suggest a shift, with rising geopolitical tensions and the re-emergence of protectionist trade policies-such as US-imposed tariffs and retaliatory measures_introducing uncertainty into global markets These developments risk a broader trend of deglobalisation and could constrain international trade.

Such changes have the potential to directly impact our client base, particularly those engaged in cross-border trade with the a slowdown in global  liquidity  flows may arise from reduced international commerce , iBanFirst  remains wellpositioned to manage this risk, owing to the diversification of our client base across multiple sectors and geographies We continue to mitigate concentration risk by actively pursuing new business opportunities and cultivating a broad, resilient portfolio of client relationships.

## Principal risks and uncertainties (continued)

## Regulatory challenges:

The payments and foreign exchange sector continues to operate under a high level of regulatory scrutiny; with sustained emphasis on robust  governance and effective risk management. areas of regulatory focus include financial crime   prevention, capital adequacy, liquidity management,  operational resilience , FCA Consumer Duty compliance, and the safeguarding of client funds: Key

Non-compliance with these obligations could expose the   Company to significant   regulatory   penalties, operational  disruption, In  response, the directors remain firmly   committed to maintaining a strong compliance culture across the organisation: This includes ongoing investment in our risk management   framework; and the continuous enhancement   of our systems and controls to ensure full adherence to both Regulatory Compliance and Regulatory Reporting requirements Our proactive approach seeks not only to developments across the markets in which we operate.

## IT and cybersecurity risk

The Company's reliance on sophisticated IT systems and platforms to support its operations and client service exposes us to digital resilience and cybersecurity risks: At this stage, iBanFirst Limited's IT infrastructure is mainly provided and managed by its sister company, iBanFirst SA. The rise in threats, including hacking, phishing; malware, and ransomware attacks , has  increased  companies' vulnerability to potential IT and cybersecurity breaches The materialisation of these risks could impact our operational efficiency, financial stability, and reputation. regulatory non-compliance, and erosion of customer trust cyber

To address these risks, iBanFirst Ltd, through  iBanFirst SA, has  implemented a comprehensive IT and cybersecurity framework that includes the following measures:

- Robust Security Policies: Establishing and enforcing stringent security policies and procedures to ensure the protection of data and IT systems.
- Advanced Security Technologies: Investing in state-of-the-art security technologies, such as firewalls, intrusion detection systems,and encryption, to safeguard our digital assets _

- Vendor Management: Implementing  stringent due diligence and monitoring processes for third-party vendors to ensure adhere to our cybersecurity standards: they

## Foreign currency exposure:

The Company maintains a limited number of relationships with overseas suppliers and is therefore subject to a degree of foreign exchange (FX) risk  In addition, the Company holds both assets and liabilities in foreign currencies, including intercompany loans and operational balances:

Non-GBP balances are primarily maintained to serve as a natural hedge against  corresponding non-GBP liabilities, thereby reducing exposure to currency fluctuations. Foreign currency profits that are not required for hedging or operational purposes are periodically converted into GBP in order to minimise FX risk and maintain a stable financial position:

## Principal risks and uncertainties (continued)

## Liquidity:

The Directors understand that the Company must maintain sufficient liquidity to meet its operational needs Failure to manage liquidity effectively could impact our ability to meet financial obligations, maintain capital adequacy ad respond to market stresses due to an unforeseen shortage of funds or the need to obtain funds at significantly higher interest rates than under normal conditions due to liquidity stress in the market  The directors continuously monitor liquidity resenves, capital resources, and mark-to-market position by implementing forecasting and controls to mitigate potential risks and ensure long-term financial resilience: In addition, stress tests are regularly conducted to assess the expected financing needs The Company's holding company has sufficient financing agreements in place as an additional risk mitigation if liquidity strains were to arise.

## Tightening of margins: profit

As the foreign exchange market continues to mature and become more competitive, client expectations around pricing are evolving:

To mitigate this risk, the Company maintains strong relationships with multiple counterparties, enabling us to access competitive pricing and secure optimal spreads for our clients: In addition, we differentiate ourselves through the quality of our customer service and the value-added products and tools we offer: By focusing on delivering an exceptional client experience and a comprehensive suite of solutions, the Company aims to maintain sustainable margins while supporting long-term client loyalty and growth.

We are independent of the company in accordance with the ethical requirements that are relevant to our audit of the financial statements in the United Kingdom, including the Financial Reporting Councils Ethical  Standard and we have fulfilled our other ethical responsibilities in accordance with these requirements. We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion:

## Conclusions relating to going concern

Our evaluation of the directors' assessment of the company's ability to continue to adopt the going concern basis of accounting included:

Based on the work we have performed, we have not identified any material uncertainties relating to events or conditions that; individually or collectively, may cast significant doubt on the company's ability to continue as a going concern for a period of at least twelve months from when the financial statements are authorised for issue.

We have nothing to report in this regard.

- the strategic report and the directors' report have been prepared in accordance with applicable legal requirements:

## Matters on which we are required to report by exception

In the light of the knowledge and understanding of the company and its environment obtained in the course of the audit; we have not identified material misstatements in the strategic report or the directors' report:

We have nothing to report in respect of the following matters in relation to which the Companies Act 2006 requires us to report to you if, in our opinion:

As explained more fully in the directors' responsibilities statement on page 6, the directors are responsible for the preparation of the financial statements and for being satisfied that give a true and fair view, and for such internal control as the directors determine is necessary to enable the preparation of financial statements that are free from material misstatement; whether due to fraud or error: they

In preparing the financial statements, the directors are responsible for assessing the company's ability to continue as a going concern, disclosing, as applicable, matters related to going concern and using the going concern basis Of accounting unless the directors either intend to liquidate the company or to cease operations, or have no realistic alternative but to do so

## Auditors' responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements

Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements as a whole are free from material misstatement,  whether due to fraud or error, and to issue an auditors' report that includes our opinion. Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with ISAs (UK) will always detect a material misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these financial statements. they

Irregularities, including fraud, are instances of   non-compliance with laws and   regulations. We design procedures in line with our responsibilities, outlined above, to detect material misstatements in respect of irregularities,  including fraud: The extent to which our procedures are including fraud is detailed below.

We gained an understanding of the legal and regulatory framework applicable to the company and the industry in which it operates, and considered the risk of acts by the company that were contrary to applicable laws and regulations, including fraud: We discussed with the directors the policies and procedures in place regarding compliance with laws and   regulations We discussed   amongst the identified laws and regulations, and remained alert to any indications of non-compliance:

## IBANFIRST LIMITED

## INDEPENDENT AUDITORS' REPORT TO THE MEMBERS OF IBANFIRST LIMITED (CONTINUED)

## Auditor's responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements (continued)

During the audit we focused on laws and regulations which could reasonably be expected to give rise to a material misstatement in the financial statements, including; but not limited to, the Companies Act 2006 and UK tax  legislation. the financial statement   disclosures to underlying supporting documentation:

Our procedures in relation to fraud included but were not limited to: inquiries of management whether have any knowledge of any actual, suspected or alleged fraud, and discussions amongst the audit team regarding risk of fraud such as opportunities for fraudulent manipulation of financial statements. We determined that the principal risks related to posting manual journal entries to manipulate financial performance and management bias through judgements in accounting estimates: We also addressed the risk of management override of internal controls; including testing journals and evaluating whether there was evidence of bias by the directors that represented a risk of material misstatement due to fraud. they

Because of the inherent limitations of an audit;, there is a risk that we will not detect all irregularities, including those leading to a material misstatement in the financial statements or non-compliance with regulation. This risk increases the more that compliance with a law or regulation is removed from the events and transactions reflected in the financial statements, as we will be less likely to become aware of instances of non-compliance. The risk is also greater regarding irregularities occurring due to fraud rather than error; as fraud involves intentional concealment, forgery, collusion, omission or misrepresentation.

further description of our responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements is located on the Financial Reporting Councils website at: WWW_ This   description forms  part of our auditors' report.

## Use of our report

This report is made solely to the company's members, as a body, in accordance with Chapter 3 of Part 16 of the Companies Act 2006. Our audit work has been undertaken so that we might state to the company's members those matters we are required to state to them in an auditors' report and for no other purpose: To the fullest extent permitted by law, we do not accept or assume responsibility to anyone other than the company and the company's members, as a body; for our audit work, for this report, or for the opinions we have formed.
